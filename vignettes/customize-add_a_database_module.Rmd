## Overview

Database connections in ReviewR are created with the help of the [DBI Package](https://db.rstudio.com/dbi/) from RStudio. This allows ReviewR to interact with any database supported by DBI. A full list of compatible database back-ends[*](#dplyr-support) can be found [here](https://db.rstudio.com/databases/). 

Within ReviewR, DBI connection objects are programmatically created to facilitate user connections to patient databases. This connection object defines the type of database, connection information (ip, port, etc.), and the user with any associated credentials. These connection objects can then be used to create connections to tables within the database.

### Database Modules

ReviewR facilitates these DBI connections through the use of  [Shiny Modules](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html). Modules are a way to make a complex Shiny application more manageable. They help compartmentalize code and each module is developed for a specific purpose. At their core, modules take user inputs that are defined in a User Interface (UI) function, process the user inputs in a server function and return an output. Each module operates in its own namespace, meaning that shiny modules are portable and can be used in other applications and/or reusable within the same application. 

ReviewR has developed a way to interactively switch between database modules that have been developed for the package. These modules consist of a UI to guide the user through establishing a database connection and a server responsible for validating user inputs, establishing a connection, and returning a DBI connection object. Users can extend the functionality of ReviewR by adding developed database modules to `R/mod_database_setup.R` as shown below:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Database Module Setup ----
      namespace <- 'db-selector-ns'
      # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Add Database Setup Modules Here!!! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #
      ## Add Database Setup Modules Here
      database_setup_vars <- reactiveValues(bigquery = shinyBigQuery::bigquery_setup_server(id = namespace ),
                                            postgresql = shinyPostgreSQL::postgresql_setup_server(id = namespace ) #,
                                            # new_module = ReviewR::new_module_setup_server(id = namespace)
                                            )
      # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #
```

Once modules are added to the package, they will appear in the Patient Database Module drop down on the setup tab. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('database_module.gif')
```

## Developing a Database Module for ReviewR

Creating a Shiny module is very similar to developing a stand alone Shiny App. When developing a database module for ReviewR, there are a few differences that result because of its package architecture. A [template](#reviewr-database-module-template) has been provided so that some aspects of ReviewR database module development can be highlighted in the sections that follow. 

### Getting Started

The first step to developing a new ReviewR module will be to clone the latest version of ReviewR from GitHub. This will ensure you have access to the latest development tools and file structure of the ReviewR package. For simplicity, clone the repository to your home directory:
```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('usethis')
usethis::create_from_github(repo_spec = 'thewileylab/ReviewR', destdir = '~/')
```

Navigate to the cloned directory and open the `ReviewR.Rproj` file. This will open the project in RStudio. Finally, using the devtools package run:
```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::load_all()
```

This will load the most recent version of ReviewR. At this point, you are ready to begin developing a database module.

### General Module Structure

Take note of the [ReviewR Database Module Template](#reviewr-database-module-template). It consists of 2 functions: 

* database_setup_ui - Defines the user interface that will guide someone through the database connection process
* database_setup_server - Defines what actions to take as a result of user inputs. 

ReviewR utilizes the [`moduleServer()`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.5.0/moduleServer.html) function introduced in Shiny 1.5. This allows the server portion of a module to be called within your application just like any other function, instead of relying on the previous `callModule()` syntax. 

The next thing to note is that ReviewR modules will ultimately become a part of the ReviewR package namespace. This means that both the UI and Server functions require roxygen comments, with all function parameters, returns, and necessary package imports declared. 

For additional information on module development, please see: https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html

### Requirements

* a UI function defined as `{module_name}_setup_ui` that accepts a single parameter (id)
* a server function defined as `{module_name}_setup_server` with a reactiveValues return
    + reactiveValues must contain the following variables, with these initial values set
      + moduleName = 'Your Database Module Name'
      + moduleType = 'database'
      + setup_ui = ReviewR::database_setup_ui
      + is_connected = 'no'
      + db_con = NULL

### Start Developing!

A helper function has been provided along with ReviewR to help jumpstart the process. Run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ReviewR:::dev_database_module(mod_name = 'your_moudle', display_name = 'Your Module Display Name')
```

#### UI Function

This will create a module file in the `R/` directory of the ReviewR package and open it for editing. Begin by adding [Shiny Widgets](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html) to the `tagList()` in the UI function that users will use to enter their database credentials. Consider adding a "Connect" and "Disconnect" button to your UI which can be monitored by your server function and used to store the user entered credentials and combine them into a DBI connection object. Specifics will vary by database. Remember to wrap all user inputID's with the `ns()` function, so that they will inherit the module namespace. 
```{r pseudo_ui_code, eval=F}
tagList(
  actionButton(inputId = ns('connect'),label = 'connect'),
  actionButton(inputId = ns('disconnect'),label = 'disconnect')
  )
```


#### Example 'Connect' Server Logic

As mentioned previously, the entire goal of a ReviewR database module is to construct a DBI connection object with user entered information. This DBI connection object needs to be assigned to the `db_con` reactive values object, say when a user clicks a button labeled 'connect'. However, this user entered information should be validated. Consider the following pseudo code:

```{r pseudo_server_code, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
## Observe a connect button, defined in the UI function
observeEvent(input$connect, {
  ## When the button is pressed, store a temporary connection
  temp_con <- DBI::dbConnect(drv = dataase_driver(),
                             user = input$username, ## A text input, with a username
                             pass = input$password ## A password input
                             )
  ## Design a test to validate the temporary connection object
  test_result <- connection_test(temp_con)
  
  ## If the test passes, update the reactiveValues objects for the `is_connected` and `db_con` variables
  if(test_result == TRUE) {
    database_export$is_connected <- 'yes'
    database_export$db_con <- temp_con
    ## Else, don't create connection info
  } else {
    database_export$is_connected <- 'no'
  }
})
## Let ReviewR handle the rest!
```

The database setup module in ReviewR is 'observing' the return of the currently selected database module. When the `is_connected` variable changes to 'yes', it knows that *valid* connection information is present, and it can begin working with the connected database. 

#### Example 'Disconnect' Server Logic

Database modules are also responsible for clearing connection information when a user wants to disconnect. Here is a simple example of a database disconnect where a user presses a 'disconnect' button:
```{r pseudo_server_code2, eval=FALSE}
## Observe a connect button, defined in the UI function
observeEvent(input$disconnect, (
  ## Tell the database you are disconnecting
  DBI::dbDisconnect(database_export$db_con)
  ## Clear the connection info
  database_export$db_con <- NULL
  ## Set `is_connected` variable back to 'no'
  database_export$is_connected <- 'no'
))
```

#### Other Considerations

Think about how users will be interacting with this module. When a button is clicked, how will they notice that changes are being processed? Will an error message be displayed if incorrect credentials are entered? When connected, will a success message be presented?

As you are developing/testing, remember to add your completed `setup_server` function to `R/mod_database_setup.R` in order to have the module display within ReviewR. When incorporated into ReviewR, the `moduleName` parameter of the database module's reactiveValues return will be what appears in the Database Module Selector drop down list. Once you are sure you have added your module to `mod_database_setup.R` and you are ready to test, run:

```{r eval=F}
golem::document_and_reload()
```

This will incorporate your newly developed module into the ReviewR namespace, allowing you to see any changes that you have made as a result of your development process. 

### Finishing up

Once you are satisfied with your module and have sufficiently tested its functionality, run:
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install()
```

To install a new version of the ReviewR package with your newly developed module incorporated.
